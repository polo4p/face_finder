# face_finder

A repository to extract the photos with your face from a large ammount of pictures. First part of the code hugely inspired from https://github.com/anisayari/easy_facial_recognition.

# How to use 

First, make sure to have all the requirements from requirements.txt installed. Then, put all the faces you want to detect in the "faces" folder, with the files properly named (name.png). After launching the program, you should have a folder named "processed", containing one folder for each name.
